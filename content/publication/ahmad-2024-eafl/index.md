abstract: Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis (ACSA) involves identifying sentiment
  categories for specific aspects of a sentence. Despite the progress made in pre-trained
  language models for extracting semantic and categorical representations, the sharing
  of sensitive data remains challenging due to data privacy protection. Federated
  Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling decentralized model training without
  accessing raw datasets. However, isolated data encounters difficulties with text
  heterogeneity, which is crucial for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) subtask
  like ACSA. To address these problems, this paper presents a novel method called
  the Equilibrium Augmentation Mechanism to Enhance Federated Learning for Aspect
  Category Sentiment Analysis (EAFL-ACSA). The EAFL mechanism seamlessly integrates
  FLâ€™s data privacy preservation capabilities with a variety of augmented data representations.
  Our unified model safeguards data privacy through FL and incorporates multiple features
  through data augmentation to enhance encrypted data. Furthermore, the parameter-efficient
  tuning mechanism incorporated in our framework enhances model performance and generates
  fine-tuned augmented sentences. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets
  demonstrates that EAFL consistently outperforms the best models, achieving a competitive
  level of performance while protecting data privacy. The equilibrium data augmentation
  mechanism not only advances aspect category detection but also enhances semantic
  data representations, effectively addressing critical concerns surrounding data
  privacy preservation within a unified framework.

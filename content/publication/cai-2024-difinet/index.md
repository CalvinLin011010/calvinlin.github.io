abstract: Nested Named Entity Recognition (Nested NER) entails identifying and classifying
  entity spans within the text, including the detection of named entities that are
  embedded within external entities. Prior approaches primarily employ span-based
  techniques, utilizing the power of exhaustive searches to address the challenge
  of overlapping entities. Nonetheless, these methods often grapple with the absence
  of explicit guidance for boundary detection, resulting insensitivity in discerning
  minor variations within nested spans. To this end, we propose a Boundary-aware Semantic
  $n̆derlineDi$fferentiation and $d̆erlineFi$ltration $uĕrlineNet$work (DiFiNet) tailored
  for nested NER. Specifically, DiFiNet leverages a biaffine attention mechanism to
  generate a span representation matrix. This matrix undergoes further refinement
  through a self-adaptive semantic differentiation module, specifically engineered
  to discern semantic variances across spans. Furthermore, DiFiNet integrates a boundary
  filtration module, designed to mitigate the impact of non-entity noise by leveraging
  semantic relations among spans. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
  demonstrate our model yields a new state-of-the-art performance.
